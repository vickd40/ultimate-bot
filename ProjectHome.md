By: Ultimate Zero.

Only version 2.0 of the bot has AI (Artificial Intelligence).

LATEST VERSION: 3.1 (02/01/2012)

last update: 02/01/2012

if there is any bugs or errors please report about it on my Nimbuzz id

ultimate~zero@nimbuzz.com
or send me email:
ultimate.zero1994@gmail.com

you have to install Python27 before you be able to run this bot.

So after I realized that Nimbuzz is going to take long time until they block entering chatrooms from non-nimbuzz clients; I decided to update my bot and work on it again, this time with pretty cool features that other bots do not have yet.

Please read Changes.txt file after downloading the bot to learn more about new features.

Note: The disconnecting issue has been totally fixed, now you don't have to use anti idle command.

I hope you enjoy the new features. If you have any suggestions or complaints, feel free to email me on ultimate.zero1994@gmail.com

For developers: if you want to copy my plugins, please do not change the plugin header.
